# House-Price-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Algorithm
The "House Price Prediction using Machine Learning" project focuses on predicting housing prices using machine learning techniques. By leveraging popular Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn (sklearn), Matplotlib and Seaborn.This project provides an end-to-end solution for accurate price estimation.

# Objectives:
To develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting house prices based on various features such as size, location, amenities, and other relevant factors.

# Methodology:
1. Data Acquisition: Collect a comprehensive dataset containing house price information and corresponding features from reliable sources like real estate databases, public records, or online platforms.
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for analysis by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Perform feature engineering to create new or transform existing features that may improve model performance.
3. Model Selection: Choose a suitable machine learning algorithm, such as Random Forest Regressor, for the task. Consider factors like the nature of the data, desired accuracy, and computational efficiency.
4. Model Training: Train the selected algorithm on the prepared dataset, adjusting hyperparameters as needed to optimize performance.
5. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's accuracy using cross-validation with RMSE as a metric. This helps assess the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.

# Key Features:
* Cross-Validation with RMSE: Ensures reliable evaluation of the model's performance.
* Random Forest Regressor: A powerful ensemble learning algorithm capable of handling non-linear relationships and providing feature importance.
* Feature Engineering: Creates new features or transforms existing ones to improve model accuracy.
* Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizes the model's performance by adjusting its parameters.
